Hi üëãüèª
I am Ahmed a Frontend Developer with strong JavaScript programming expertise for 5 years focusing on React/React Native; constructing clean and quality products.

I love implementing scalable, maintainable, testable, clean solutions - following established written procedures, guidelines, techniques, and best practices with a good eye for design and details.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques is important to me as well as sharing knowledge and guiding junior developers and learn from seniors.

Shortly while and after graduating and getting my bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems, I took many online courses one of which is [Harvard University](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course CS50, I am currently working at [YourWelcome.com](https://www.yourwelcome.com) based in London, UK.

Here are some of my strongest skills:
